<p>Our audio processing work begins with the <strong>Stage 1</strong> or <strong>Mezzanine</strong> masters. These master files are not track-separated, allowing us to concentrate fully on the sonic properties of the audio masters before we dive into the weeds of track separation, dithering, metadata, and other distribution concerns.</p>

<p>We do this first step in order to streamline our communications and workflow. By validating the sonic properties of the master up-front, we get the hardest and most time-consuming task out of the way as early as possible, in order to provide ample time to work out any grainy details well within the projectâ€™s deadline.</p>

<p>Another benefit to our unique mastering approach is that from a single audio master asset, we can easily generate masters optimized for specific digital streaming platforms, physical release standards (CD-DA aka Redbook, 33 or 45 RPM vinyl, cassette, DVD, Bluray), etc.</p>
