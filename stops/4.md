## Stage 2 Masters

Once our **Stage 1** mastering process has been completed and signed off by the client, our software automatically derives masters specifically designed to meet the specifications of each planned distribution endpoint:

### Mastered for Digital

To ensure compliance with digital streaming endpoints, all of our digital stream masters are output to EBU R128 specifications. This means we target a -60 LUFS noise threshold, do not let true peaks exceed -2dBTP, and maintain deviances that do not exceed Â±0.5 LU.

| Platform   | Loudness   | True Peak |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Amazon     | -12dB LUFS | -2dBTP    |
| Apple      | -16dB LUFS | -1dBTP    |
| Deezer     | -14dB LUFS | -1dBTP    |
| SoundCloud | -8dB LUFS  | -1dBTP    |
| Spotify    | -14dB LUFS | -2dBTP    |
| YouTube    | -14dB LUFS | -1dBTP    |
